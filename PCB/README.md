The file **pico_nesPCB_v2.0.zip** in this folder is the current PCB release, as found on the [releases](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-infonesPlus/releases/latest) page. This zip file contains the Gerber files and can be uploaded to a PCB manufacturer of choice.

**pico_nesPCB_v2.1.zip** is identical to v2.0, except that D3 and D4 of NES controller port 2 are mapped to GPIO28 (D3) and GPIO27 (D4). This is intended for possible zapper use, which is currently in beta.

The v0.2 folder contains the previous version of the design.
