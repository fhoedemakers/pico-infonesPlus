# pico-infonesPlus.

## Introduction.

A NES (Nintendo Entertainment System) emulator with SD card and menu support for the Raspberry Pi Pico, Raspberry Pi Pico 2 and other RP2040/RP2350 based microcontrollers. Uses HDMI for display. 

Supports two controllers for two player games. [See "about two player games" below for specifics and limitations](#about-two-player-games) 

The emulator used is  [Infones by Jay Kumogata](https://github.com/jay-kumogata/InfoNES) which was ported to the [Raspberry Pi Pico by Shuichi Takano](https://github.com/shuichitakano/pico-infones) with changes done by me to accomodate the SD card menu.

Create a FAT32 or exFAT formatted SD card and copy your NES roms and optional [metadata](#using-metadata) on to it. It is possible to organize your roms into different folders. Then insert the SD Card into the card slot. Needless to say you must own all the roms you put on the card.

A menu is added to the emulator, which reads the roms from the SD card and shows them on screen for the user to select,  flash and play.

See below for [possible configurations](#possible-configurations), [supported game controllers](#gamecontroller-support) and how to [setup](#setup).  There is even a custom [PCB (printed circuit board)](#pcb-with-raspberry-pi-pico-or-pico-2) available and a [3D-printable case design](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-infonesPlus#3d-printed-case) which fits the PCB.

[See also the Adafruit guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/nes-emulator-for-rp2040-dvi-boards).

There is also an emulator port for the Sega Master System/Sega Game Gear, Nintendo DMG Game Boy/Game Boy Color and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. You can find them here:

## Possible configurations

You can use it with these RP2040/RP2350 boards and configurations:

- Raspberry Pi Pico, Pico 2, [Pimoroni Pico Plus 2](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pimoroni-pico-plus-2?variant=42092668289107). Requires one of these addons:
  - [Pimoroni Pico DV Demo Base](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pimoroni-pico-dv-demo-base?variant=39494203998291) hdmi add-on board. For use with a USB gamecontroller or up to two a legacy NES controllers. (NES controller ports require soldering)
  - Breadboard and
    - [Adafruit DVI Breakout For HDMI Source Devices](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4984)
    - [Adafruit Micro-SD breakout board+](https://www.adafruit.com/product/254).
      
    For use with a USB gamecontroller or up to two legacy NES controllers. (No soldering requirerd)
    
  - A custom printed circuit board (PCB) designed by [@johnedgarpark](https://twitter.com/johnedgarpark). (requires soldering) Up to two NES controller ports can be added to this PCB. Can also be used with a USB gamecontroller. You can 3d print your own NES-like case for the PCB. The Pimoroni Pico Plus 2 is not suitable for this PCB because of the SP/CE connector on back of the board
    
  - An additional PCB design for Waveshare RP2040 & RP2350 Zero including case design by DynaMight1124 based around cheaper but harder to solder components for those that fancy a bigger challenge. It also allows the design to be smaller.

  - A further PCB design has also been created for the new Waveshare RP2350 USB A board, this allows a very small PicoNES console to be made using USB control pads only. By far the most challenging to solder, if thats your thing!
 
- [Adafruit Feather RP2040 with DVI](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5710) (HDMI) Output Port. For use with a USB gamecontroller, up to two legacy NES controllers, or even a WII classic controller. Requires these addons:
  - Breadboard
  - SD reader  (choose one below)
    - [Adafruit Micro-SD breakout board+](https://www.adafruit.com/product/254).
    - [FeatherWing - RTC + SD](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2922). (not tested by me, but should work)
   
- [Waveshare RP2040-PiZero Development Board](https://www.waveshare.com/rp2040-pizero.htm)

  For use with a USB gamecontroller, up to two legacy NES controllers, or a WII classic controller. (No soldering requirerd)

  You can 3d print your own NES-like case for for this board. This does require some soldering.

- [Waveshare RP2350-PiZero Development Board](https://www.waveshare.com/rp2350-pizero.htm) Supports the optional PSRAM chip. When installed, the emulator loads ROMs from PSRAM instead of flash memory for significantly faster performance. Fully functional even without PSRAM.

- [Adafruit Metro RP2350](https://www.adafruit.com/product/6003) Supports the optional PSRAM chip. When installed, the emulator loads ROMs from PSRAM instead of flash memory for significantly faster performance. Fully functional even without PSRAM.

- [Pimoroni Pico Plus 2](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pimoroni-pico-plus-2?variant=42092668289107)

  Use the breadboard config as mentioned above. Works also on the Pimoroni Pico DV Demo base. This board does not fit the PCB because of the SP/CE connector on back of the board.
  The PSRAM on the board is used in stead of flash to load the roms from SD.

- [Adafruit Fruit Jam](https://www.adafruit.com/product/6200)
No additional hardware is required apart from a USB gamepad. Audio is output through the included speaker, with the option to connect external speakers or a Wii Classic controller via Stemma QT. The PSRAM on the board is used in stead of flash to load the roms from SD.

[See below to see how to setup your specific configuration.](#Setup)

> [!NOTE]
> It seems that sellers on AliExpress have copied the PCB design and are selling pre-populated PCB's. I do not condone this in any way. 
> For questions about those boards, please contact the seller on AliExpress.

## Gamecontroller support
Depending on the hardware configuration, the emulator supports these gamecontrollers. An USB-Y cable is needed to both connect power and a gamecontroller to the usb-port.

### USB  game Controllers
- Sony Dual Shock 4
- Sony Dual Sense
- BUFFALO BGC-FC801 connected to USB - not tested
- Genesis Mini 1 and 2
- [Retro-bit 8 button Genesis-USB](https://www.retro-bit.com/controllers/genesis/#usb)
- PlayStation Classic
- Keyboard
- XInput type of controllers like Xbox 360 and Xbox One controllers and other XInput compatible controllers like 8bitDo.
- Mantapad, cheap [NES](https://nl.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-nes-controller-usb.html?spm=a2g0o.home.search.0) and [SNES](https://nl.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-snes-controller-usb.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.search.0) USB controllers from AliExpress. Although cheap and working i do not recommended them.

See also [troubleshooting USB controllers below](#troubleshooting-usb-controllers)

>[!NOTE]
> There is some input lag when using USB controllers.

#### Optional Second USB-Port for game controller use.
In some configurations, a second USB port is available for connecting a USB game controller. The built-in USB port remains dedicated to power and firmware flashing, so there is no need for a USB-Y cable.

This feature is enabled by default on the Adafruit Fruit Jam and Waveshare RP2350-PiZero. For other boards, you’ll need to [build the firmware from source](#building-from-source) to enable it, as the pre-built binaries do not include this option.

For more info, see [pio_usb.md](pio_usb.md).

### Legacy controllers
- One or optional two original NES controllers for two player games.  In some configurations, soldering is required.
- WII-classic controller: Adafruit Feather RP2040 and WaveShare RP2040 Pi-Zero boards only

## About two player games

The emulator supports two player games using two NES controllers or an USB gamecontroller and a NES controller.

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot use two USB controllers for two player games.
> At the moment only one USB controller is recognized by the driver. In this case the USB controller is always player 1. Player 2 must be a NES controller.


| | Player 1 | Player 2 |
| --- | -------- | -------- |
| USB controller connected | USB | NES port 1 or NES port 2 |
| No usb controller connected | NES port 1| NES port 2 |

***
## PSRAM
Some boards support additional memory called PSRAM with a capacity of 8MB On certain boards this comes pre-installed, while on others it is optional and must be soldered manually. When PSRAM is detected, the emulator will automatically make use of it.

Without PSRAM, selecting a game ROM triggers a reboot: the ROM is written to flash memory during startup to prevent the system from locking up. This process is relatively slow, taking several seconds before the game starts.

With PSRAM, this step is no longer needed. Games are loaded directly from the SD card into PSRAM and executed immediately, resulting in much faster startup times.

| Board | PSRAM Included |
|:--|:--|
| [Waveshare RP2350-PiZero](https://www.waveshare.com/rp2350-pizero.htm) | No – optional, must be soldered ([PSRAM module](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4677)) |
| [Adafruit Metro RP2350 with PSRAM](https://www.adafruit.com/product/6267) | Yes – pre-installed |
| [Pimoroni Pico Plus 2](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pimoroni-pico-plus-2) | Yes – pre-installed |


***

## Warning
Repeatedly flashing your Pico will eventually wear out the flash memory. 

The emulator overclocks the Pico in order to get the emulator working fast enough. Overclocking can reduce the Pico's lifespan.

Use this software at your own risk! I will not be responsible in any way for any damage to your Pico and/or connected peripherals caused by using this software.

I also do not take responsability in any way when damage is caused to the Pico or display due to incorrect wiring or voltages.

## Waveshare RP2040/RP2350-PiZero Development Board

### materials needed

- One of these Waveshare boards:
  - [Waveshare RP2040-PiZero Development Board](https://www.waveshare.com/rp2040-pizero.htm).
  - [Waveshare RP2350-PiZero Development Board](https://www.waveshare.com/rp2350-pizero.htm).
    - Optional: [PSRAM chip](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4677) When installed, the emulator loads ROMs from PSRAM instead of flash memory for significantly faster performance. Fully functional even without PSRAM
- [USB-C to USB-A cable](https://a.co/d/2i7rJid) for flashing the uf2 onto the board.
- USB-C Power supply. Connect to the port labelled USB, not PIO-USB. See note below.
- [Mini HDMI to HDMI Cable](https://a.co/d/5BZg3Z6).
- FAT32 or exFAT formatted Micro SD card with roms you legally own. Roms must have the .nes extension. You can organise your roms into different folders.

Additional for the RP2040-Pizero only:

- [USB-C to USB-C - USB-A Y cable](https://a.co/d/eteMZLt). when using an USB controller. Not needed for the Waveshare RP2350-PiZero where the controller **must** be connected to the PIO-USB port.

> [!NOTE]
> Unlike the WaveShare RP2350-PiZero, where the controller must be connected to the PIO-USB port, the WaveShare RP2040-PiZero Development Board cannot use the PIO-USB port for the controller due to memory limitations.  Instead, connect both the controller and the power adapter to the Y-cable, and then plug the Y-cable into the board’s port labeled “USB.” While the PIO-USB port can still be used to power the RP2040 board, I do not recommend this, as it has occasionally caused unstable behavior.

#### NES controller port.

When using a original NES controller you need:

- [NES controller port](https://www.zedlabz.com/products/controller-connector-port-for-nintendo-nes-console-7-pin-90-degree-replacement-2-pack-black-zedlabz)
- [An original NES controller](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=NES+controller&crid=1CX7W9NQQDF8H&sprefix=nes+controller%2Caps%2C174&ref=nb_sb_noss_1)
- [Dupont female to female wires](https://a.co/d/cJVmnQO)

For two player games with two NES controllers you need an extra NES controller port, controller and wire


|           | Port 1 | Port 2 (Optional) | Note |
| ------------- | ---- | ----- | ---------- |
| GND           |      | | Any ground pin |
| VCC (Power)   |      | | 5Volt pin         |
| NES Clock     | GPIO5 | GPIO10 |          |
| NES LATCH     | GPIO9 | GPIO11|        |
| NES Data      | GPIO6 | GPIO12|        |

![Image](assets/nes-controller-pinout.png)

> [!NOTE]
> Contrary to other configurations where VCC is connected to 3Volt, VCC should be connected to a 5Volt pin. Otherwise the NES controller could possibly not work.

#### WII-Classic controller.

When using a WII-Classic controller you need:

-  [Adafruit Wii Nunchuck Breakout Adapter - Qwiic / STEMMA QT](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4836)
-  [STEMMA QT / Qwiic JST SH 4-pin Cable with Premium Female Sockets](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4397) 
-  [WII Classic wired controller](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=wii-classic+controller)

Connections are as follows:

| Nunchuck Breakout Adapter | RP2040-PiZero |

![IMG_6011](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a55dd2ad-75a8-4115-a38f-fe0ecd6f51c7)

Several Companies  can make these PCBs for you. 

I personally recommend [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/). The boards i ordered from them are of excellent quality. They have also a very short lead time. Boards i ordered on Monday arrived from China to my home in the Netherlands on Friday of the same week.

[![Image](assets/pcbw.png)](https://www.pcbway.com/)

When ordering, simply upload the zip file containing the gerber design.  This file (pico_nesPCB_v2.1.zip) is available in the [releases page](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-infonesPlus/releases/latest) and can also be found in the [PCB](PCB/) folder. 

> [!NOTE]
>  Soldering skills are required. Make sure you solder all the connections from the Pico onto the PCB. Also the connections on the short right-side of the Pico. (For ground)

> [!NOTE]
> If you are looking for the previous design (v0.2). You can find it [here](PCB/v0.2)

> [!NOTE]
> It seems that sellers on AliExpress have copied the PCB design and are selling pre-populated PCB's. I do not condone this in any way. For questions about those boards, please contact the seller on AliExpress.

### 3D printed case for PCB

Gavin Knight ([DynaMight1124](https://github.com/DynaMight1124)) designed a NES-like case you can 3d-print as an enclosure for this pcb.  You can find it here: [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6689537](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6689537). Here you can find two designs: the latest design for PCB v2.0  and the previous design for [PCB v0.2](PCB/v0.2). In the latest v2.0 design, you can choose between two top covers, one with a button connecting to the bootsel button for easy firmware upgrades, the other without the button. In this case you have to remove the top cover to access the bootsel button. See images below. Make sure to print the correct files for the PCB version you own.

## PCB with WaveShare RP2040/RP2350 Zero

Create your own Pico-based NES console. It features two NES controller ports for 1 or 2-player games. This version is smaller than the above and uses cheaper, but ultimately harder to solder components. This is a more advanced project than the above PCB design, if you are unsure of your soldering capabilities I wouldnt recommend this PCB.

Several companies can make these PCBs for you. PCBWay or JLCPCB are two good options.

I personally recommend [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/). The boards I ordered from them are of excellent quality. They have also a very short lead time. Boards I ordered on Monday arrived from China to my home in the Netherlands on Friday of the same week.

When ordering, simply upload the zip file containing the gerber design.  This file (Gerber_PicoNES_Mini_PCB_v2.0.zip) is available in the [releases page](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-infonesPlus/releases/latest) and can also be found in the [PCB](PCB/) folder. 

> [!NOTE]
>  Soldering skills are required. Make sure you solder all the connections from the Pico onto the PCB. This version requires good soldering skills especially for the HDMI portion, a good amount of flux and a fine tip will be required, additional solder can be wicked away with solder wick. I recommend starting with the resistor arrays first, then the HDMI port, after that either Pico or MicroSD adaptor, lastly the NES Ports, which can be hard to push into the PCB.

Please see the Instrucables link for guide and components needed: https://www.instructables.com/PicoNES-RaspberryPi-Pico-Based-NES-Emulator/

### 3D printed case for PCB

Gavin Knight ([DynaMight1124](https://github.com/DynaMight1124)) designed a NES-like case you can 3D print as an enclosure for this PCB.  You can find it here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7041536. If you dont own a 3D printer, you can either find a local company that can offer 3D print services or use professional services such as PCBWay or JCLPCB, the professional services can offer extremely high quaility finishes.

# Using metadata.

Download the metadata pack from the [releases page](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-infonesPlus/releases/latest/download/PicoNesMetadata.zip) and extract its contents to the root of the SD card. It contains box art and game info for many games. The metadata is used in the menu to show box art and game info when a rom is selected. Press START to view the information. When the screensaver is started, random box art is shown.

# Save games
For games which support it, saves will be stored in the /SAVES folder of the SD card. Caution: the save ram will only be saved back to the SD card when quitting the game via (START + SELECT)

***

# Raspberry Pico W and Pico2 W support
The emulator works with the Pico W (RP2040). Use the pico_w_ or pico2_w_ versions of the uf2 files in the latest release. The Pico W has a built-in wifi module. The wifi module is not used by the emulator. It is only used for enabling the led to blink every 60 frames on the Pico W.  If you don't mind the led blinking, you can use the pico_ versions of the uf2 files on the Pico W.

# USB game Controllers latency
Using a USB gamecontroller introduces some latency. The legacy controllers ((S)NES, WII-classic) have less latency.

# Troubleshooting usb controllers

## AliExpress Controllers (Mantapad)

When starting a game, and the controller is unresponsive, you have to unplug and replug the controller to get it working. Not all controllers behave this way. I have a SNES controller that has no problems. The NES controller however must alwas be replugged to make it work. It is kind of a hit and miss.

> [!NOTE]
> When using a SNES style usb controller, press Y to properly setup the controller. Otherwise the B button will not work. You have to do this every time you start a game or boot into the menu.


## XInput style controllers.

Might not work with all controllers.

Tested devices:
- Xbox 360 : Works
- Xbox Series X controller : Works
- Xbox One controller : Works
- Xbox elite controller : Works
- 8bitdo SN30 Pro+ firmware V6.01: Works. With the controller switched off, hold X + Start to switch to XInput mode. (LED 1 and 2 will blink). Then connect to USB.
- 8bitdo Pro 2 firmware V3.04: Works. With the controller switched off, hold X + Start to switch to XInput mode. (LED 1 and 2 will blink). Then connect to USB.
- 8bitdo SN30 PRO Wired : Not working, recognized but no report
- 8bitdo SF30 PRO firmware v2.05 : Works. With the controller switched off, hold X + Start to switch to XInput mode. (LED 1 and 2 will blink). Then connect to USB.
- 8bitdo SN30 PRO firmware v2.05 : Not tested, should probably work

### Troubleshooting:

After flashing some bigger games, the controller might become unresponsive:
- Xbox Controller. Playing with batteries removed is recommended. When controller becomes unresponsive:
  - unplug and replug the controller.
  - If controller is still unresponsive, unplug the pico from power, wait a few seconds then plug it back in and press start to start the last flashed game.

- 8bitdo controllers, when controller becomes unresponsive:
  - Disconnect the controller.
  - Hold start to switch the controller off (if it has built-in battery).
  - reconnect the controller.

# Troubleshooting no image on TV or monitor

Some displays need 5V connected to the HDMI breakout in order to work:
- When using the breadboard with HDMI and SD breakout, make sure VBUS (Pin 40) is connected to the 5 volt via  on the HDMI breakout board. (Marked 5 on the side) 

![Image](assets/DVIBreakout.jpg)

***

# Known Issues and limitations

- Due to the Pico's memory limitations, not all games will work. Games not working will show a "Mapper n is unsupported." (n is a number). For example starting Castlevania III will show the "Mapper 5 is unsupported." message.
- tar file support is removed.

***

# Building from source

Best is to use the included build script [buildAll.sh](buildAll.sh). You can then copy the correct .uf2 to your Pico via the bootsel option. The script builds all the .uf2 files and puts them in the releases folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-infonesPlus.git
cd pico-infonesPlus
git submodule update --init
chmod +x build*.sh
./buildAll.sh
```

Alternatively, you can use the [bld.sh](bld.sh) shell script:

```
Build script for the piconesPlus project

Usage: ./pico_shared/bld.sh [-d] [-2 | -r] [-w] [-u] [-m] [-t path to toolchain] [ -p nprocessors] [-c <hwconfig>]
Options:
  -d: build in DEBUG configuration
  -2: build for Pico 2 board (RP2350)
  -r: build for Pico 2 board (RP2350) with riscv core
  -u: enable PIO USB support (default is disabled, RP2350 only)
  -s <ps-ram-cs>: specify the GPIO pin for PSRAM chip select (default is 47 for RP2350 boards)
  -w: build for Pico_w or Pico2_w
  -t <path to riscv toolchain>: only needed for riscv, specify the path to the riscv toolchain bin folder
     Default is $PICO_SDK_PATH/toolchain/RISCV_RPI_2_0_0_2/bin
  -p <nprocessors>: specify the number of processors to use for the build
  -c <hwconfig>: specify the hardware configuration
     1: Pimoroni Pico DV Demo Base (Default)
     2: Breadboard with Adafruit AdaFruit DVI Breakout Board and AdaFruit MicroSD card breakout board
        Custom pcb
     3: Adafruit Feather RP2040 DVI
     4: Waveshare RP2040-PiZero
     5: Adafruit Metro RP2350 (latest branch of TinyUSB is required for this board)
     6: Waveshare RP2040-Zero/RP2350-Zero with custom PCB
  -m: Run cmake only, do not build the project
  -h: display this help

To install the RISC-V toolchain:
 - Raspberry Pi: https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk-tools/releases/download/v2.0.0-5/riscv-toolchain-14-aarch64-lin.tar.gz
 - X86/64 Linux: https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk-tools/releases/download/v2.0.0-5/riscv-toolchain-14-x86_64-lin.tar.gz
and extract it to $PICO_SDK_PATH/toolchain/RISCV_RPI_2_0_0_2

Example riscv toolchain install for Raspberry Pi OS:

        cd
        sudo apt-get install wget
        wget https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk-tools/releases/download/v2.0.0-5/riscv-toolchain-14-aarch64-lin.tar.gz
        mkdir -p $PICO_SDK_PATH/toolchain/RISCV_RPI_2_0_0_2
        tar -xzvf riscv-toolchain-14-aarch64-lin.tar.gz -C $PICO_SDK_PATH/toolchain/RISCV_RPI_2_0_0_2

To build for riscv:

        ./bld.sh -c <hwconfig> -r -t $PICO_SDK_PATH/toolchain/RISCV_RPI_2_0_0_2/bin

```

When using Visual Studio code, choose the Release or the RelWithDebuginfo build variant.

## Building with support for an additional USB port using PIO-USB

In some configurations, a second USB port can be added. This port can be used to connect a gamepad. The built-in usb port will be used for power and flashing the firmware.
With this there is no need to use a USB-Y cable anymore.

For more info on how to setup and build the firmware, see [pio_usb.md](pio_usb.md).

> [!NOTE]
> You have to build the firmware from source to enable this feature. The pre-built binaries do not support this.
