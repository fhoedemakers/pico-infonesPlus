# CHANGELOG

VRC7 FM audio for Lagrange Point, a new overclock setting, more reliable HDMI audio, support for the new pico-bootLoader bootloader, and PCB design v2.2.

[See setup section in readme how to install and wire up](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-infonesPlus#pico-setup)

# v0.44

## Game support

- Added VRC7 (Yamaha OPLL) FM synthesis for *Lagrange Point (JP)*, mapper 85. HSTX boards with PSRAM only; requires the new Overclock setting to be enabled in the settings menu. Audio may still exhibit occasional glitches.

## Settings menu

- New **Overclock** setting raises the CPU clock from 252 MHz to 378 MHz (with a matching core voltage increase). It only appears on HSTX boards with PSRAM and is currently only required for *Lagrange Point (JP)*. The chosen clock is stored in flash and applied at boot.
- The file browser now starts in `/roms/NES` instead of the SD card root. If that folder does not exist, it falls back to the root folder. Putting your ROMs in `/roms/NES` is now the recommended layout.
- Note: the settings file format was bumped; existing `settings_nes.dat` files will be reset to defaults on first boot.

## HDMI

- More reliable HDMI audio on HSTX boards: audio packets are now scheduled precisely against the video clock and carry proper IEC 60958 channel-status data. This fixes audio dropouts and improves compatibility with picky TVs and AV receivers.

## pico-bootLoader

- The emulator can now be built to run under the new [pico-bootLoader](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-bootLoader) bootloader, which allows multiple emulators to be installed on a single board and selected at startup. Build with `-DBUILD_FOR_BOOTLOADER=ON`, optionally pinning the image to a 2 MB slot with `-DBUILD_FOR_BOOTLOADER_SLOT=N`. These builds show a new **Return to emulator selection** item in the menu. Standalone builds are unchanged.

## Hardware

- Added PCB design v2.2. The Pico footprint now uses through-holes, so boards with pre-soldered headers fit — like the [Pimoroni Pico Plus 2](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pimoroni-pico-plus-2?variant=42092668289107) and the Raspberry Pi Pico (2) with soldered headers. The Gerber files and PDF schematics are included in the release assets.

## Other fixes

- Synced the SD card driver with upstream pico_fatfs: improved RP2350 A/B detection and more stable SD card access.



# v0.43

## Audio

- Better audio mixing for NES games.
- Fixed a DC offset on the I2S audio.
- Added an alternative I2S audio driver based on the official pico-extras driver. This is an opt-in build option; the default driver is unchanged.

Special thanks go to [szuping](https://github.com/szuping) for his contribution to the audio fixes.

## Game fixes

- Fixed flickering on the bottom line of the top HUD in *Ganbare Goemon! - Karakuri Douchuu (Japan)*.

## HDMI

- More stable HDMI/DVI output on HSTX-based boards. Some monitors previously lost the picture intermittently and recovered with a visible glitch; the updated signal shape keeps the picture stable.

## Settings menu

- The options list is now scrollable, with up/down arrows when items extend beyond the visible window. SAVE/CANCEL/DEFAULT, the palette, and the help text stay anchored at fixed rows.
- Note: the settings file format was bumped; existing `settings_nes.dat` files will be reset to defaults on first boot.

## Developer

- Added a headless Linux host harness for the InfoNES core, so PPU/CPU/mapper bugs can be reproduced on a PC without flashing a board.



# v0.42

## Features

**Famicom Disk System**

- PSRAM is no longer required to run Famicom Disk System games. The only requirement now is an RP2350-based board.
- BIOS screen now displays correctly.
- Added "FDS Auto Insert Disk 1 on Start" setting. When set to Off, the BIOS animation keeps playing until the user presses Button2 (A) to insert the disk.

**NSF Player**

- Fixed audio clipping.
- Fixed pause/resume: elapsed time is preserved, and the player no longer skips to the next track when resuming.
- Fixed audio delay on PicoDVI boards. Audio now starts in sync with playback right from the first track.

**HDMI**

- Added 8:7 pixel aspect ratio support for HSTX boards.
- Added "Scanline Type" setting (HSTX boards only). Simple darkens odd lines; LCD adds a visible pixel-grid effect by also darkening alternating output columns. LCD is only available in 1:1 screen mode.
- Screen mode and scanline settings now behave consistently across all HDMI boards.

**USB Controllers**

- Added two-player USB controller support. On the Adafruit Fruit Jam, two controllers can be connected directly to the board’s USB ports for multiplayer games. 

This feature is confirmed working on the Adafruit Fruit Jam, Raspberry Pi Pico, and Pico 2. For the Raspberry Pi Pico and Pico 2, a USB Y-cable and USB hub are required.
Currently, this does not yet work on the Waveshare RP2350-PiZero.

Other configurations may also work when using a USB hub, but these have not yet been tested.

**Other**

- Added support for mapper 210 [#200](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-infonesPlus/issues/200)
- Test builds (VX.X) now show the build date and time on the splash screen.
- Built against the latest TinyUSB version.


## Fixes

- Fixed external audio (PCM5000A) not working on RP2040 PicoDVI boards when enabled at boot, and resolved an intermittent audio glitch on the same boards.
- Fixed audio distortion during loud sound effects on the Adafruit Fruit Jam.
- Fixed volume imbalance between headphones and speaker on Adafruit Fruit Jam. Headphone volume is now automatically attenuated when headphones are inserted, so the volume control can be set for a comfortable speaker level without blasting headphones.
- Better audio mixing for VRC6 games like Akumajou Densetsu (Castlevania III JP) [#199](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-infonesPlus/issues/199)
- Fixed background jitter in Akumajou Densetsu (Castlevania III JP) during vertical scroll sections. The playfield no longer shifts up and down by a pixel between frames.
- Fixed HUD scroll glitches in Rush'n Attack, Galaxian (JP) and Robocop 3.
- Fixed missing HUD in Alien 3.
- Fixed crash when opening the settings menu.
- Fixed a memory allocation bug in the HDMI driver on HSTX boards that wasted RAM.
- Fixed mapper 19 not working correctly [#200](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-infonesPlus/issues/200)
- Improved display sync and fixed audio clipping on first launch by feeding blank frames.
- Fixed settings menu always showing unsaved changes after the new scanline setting was added.
- Updated the build configuration to be compatible with the latest TinyUSB version. [#202](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-infonesPlus/issues/202) [#203](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-infonesPlus/issues/203)

## Downloads by configuration

Binaries for each configuration are listed below. Binaries for Pico(2) also work for Pico(2)-w. No blinking led however on the -w boards.
For some configurations risc-v binaries are available. It is recommended however to use the arm binaries. 

>[!NOTE]
> No dedicated binaries are provided for the Pico w or Pico 2w. Instead, use the Pico or Pico 2 binaries. Enabling the LED on these boards causes too many issues. [#136](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-infonesPlus/issues/136)
